PIKASONIC - Lost My Mind (feat.nakotanmaru)

You are given two points (px,py)
and (qx,qy)

on a Euclidean plane.

You start at the starting point (px,py)
and will perform n operations. In the i-th operation, you must choose any point such that the Euclidean distanceâˆ— between your current position and the point is exactly ai

, and then move to that point.

Determine whether it is possible to reach the terminal point (qx,qy)
after performing all operations.
