'''
The pink soldiers have given you a sequence a consisting of n

positive integers.

You must repeatedly perform the following operation until there is only 1

element left.

    Choose two distinct indices i

and j
.
Then, choose a positive integer value x
such that there exists a non-degenerate triangleâˆ— with side lengths ai, aj, and x
.
Finally, remove two elements ai
and aj, and append x to the end of a

    . 

Please find the maximum possible value of the only last element in the sequence a
.
